# **Financial-Indicator-Prediction**  

This project focuses on training an XGBoost machine learning model on a dataset spanning from 2014 to 2018. The dataset encompasses over 200 financial indicators commonly found in 10-K filings from a diverse range of publicly traded US stocks.

**Project Overview**: <br/>
The primary goal is to investigate whether a machine learning model can effectively differentiate between stocks that perform well and those that do not, solely based on financial indicators extracted from 10-K filings. By leveraging XGBoost, we aim to predict potential stock performance and explore the feasibility of using financial indicators for informed investment decisions.

**Dataset Description**: <br/>
The dataset consists of five files, each containing market data from 2014 to 2018 for approximately 4,392 stocks. Each row represents a unique stock, while columns represent various financial indicators. These indicators offer insights into the financial health and performance of each company, facilitating predictive modeling.

**Repository Contents**: <br/>

**Data**: Contains the dataset files for each year from 2014 to 2018. <br/>
